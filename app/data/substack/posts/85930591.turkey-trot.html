<h2><strong>Good morning!</strong></h2><p>Welcome to the fourth ever issue of Monday Morning Data Science from the <a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/">Fred Hutch Data Science Laboratory</a>. We are excited to show you what we have been working on (Fresh from the Lab), plus links that we think you would be interested in (Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar). Part of <strong>the purpose of this newsletter is to start conversations</strong>, so if you have a question or there is something you would like to share with us please <strong>let us know by responding directly to this email</strong>.</p><h2>Fresh from the Lab</h2><p>It is Thanksgiving week in the United States, so we are not hosting events this week. Instead we want to highlight some courses we have either created or collaborated on that you might want to peruse over the winter break:</p><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://www.opencasestudies.org/">Open Case Studies</a>]</strong> is an educational resource of case studies, which demonstrate illustrative data analyses that can be used to learn how to effectively derive knowledge from data. Each case study focuses on an important public health topic and introduces methods to provide you with the skills and knowledge for greater legibility, reproducibility, rigor, and flexibility in data analyses.</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="http://jtleek.com/ads2020/">Advanced Data Science</a>]</strong> is a course designed for graduate students in the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, but this week we are bringing it to you! The primary goal of the course is to teach you how to deconstruct, perform, and communicate professional data analyses across diverse media.</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://leanpub.com/modernscientist">How to be a Modern Scientist</a>] </strong>The face of academia is changing. It is no longer sufficient to just publish or perish. We are now in an era where Twitter, Github, Figshare, and Alt Metrics are regular parts of the scientific workflow. Here Jeff Leek gives high level advice about which tools to use, how to use them, and what to look out for.</p></li></ul><h2>Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar</h2><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://twitter.com/NikkiSiapno/status/1593882400983072769">Git Cheatsheet</a>] </strong>Software engineer<strong> </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/NikkiSiapno">Nikki Siapno</a> makes amazing illustrated guides for programmers and we love her latest work explaining basic Git workflows.</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://effectivepython.com/">Python Mastery</a>] </strong>ML engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1594360110675099648">Vicki Boykis</a> recommended one of her favorite Python books and we agree that it is a masterpiece!</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://twitter.com/kierisi/status/1592917594834894850">Data Science Interviews</a>] </strong>Two of our favorite data scientists, <a href="https://twitter.com/kierisi">Jesse Mostipak</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ChelseaParlett">Chelsea Parlett</a> just did a fantastic interview together.</p></li></ul><p>As always you can contact us by replying directly to this email, you can email Jeff Leek, Amy Paguirigan, and Sean Kross at data@fredhutch.org, or you are welcome to join us on the F<a href="https://fhdata.slack.com/">red Hutch Data Slack Workspace</a>.
