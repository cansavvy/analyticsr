<h2><strong>Good morning!</strong></h2><p>Welcome to the tenth ever issue of Monday Morning Data Science from the <a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/">Fred Hutch Data Science Laboratory</a>. We are excited to show you what we have been working on (Fresh from the Lab), plus links that we think you would be interested in (Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar). Part of <strong>the purpose of this newsletter is to start conversations</strong>, so if you have a question or there is something you would like to share with us please <strong>let us know by responding directly to this email</strong>.</p><h2>Fresh from the Lab</h2><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/ics/Repeating-Events/Effective-Computing-User-Group.ics">Event: Effective Computing User Group</a>] </strong>TUESDAY (delayed a day due to the holiday) 1/3 at 12pm the Effective Computing user group will meet again (they meet every other week) in room M1-B612 and <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a7128526d3409428c969260d7dcce2f6b%40thread.skype/1662765831185?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%220054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%223e04c34b-5757-41eb-859a-2ca7ed21694c%22%7d">here on Teams</a>. The focus is on learning about how to scale up your computing work from your laptop to whatever scale meets your needs. This group is hosted by the Fred Hutch DaSL in collaboration with the Hutch Data Core and Scientific Computing.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/ics/Repeating-Events/Fred-Hutch-R-User-Group.ics">Event: R User Group</a>] </strong>Tuesday 1/3 at 2pm the monthly R User group will be meeting online only<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a78f58da7a7ad414fb4d628f8ba974ee3%40thread.skype/1668473281445?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%220054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22fe38bc0c-bc6f-4396-bf10-c217dda4deb3%22%7d"> on Teams</a>. This week Sean Kross will be talking about creating functions and packages. If you would like to talk about an R subject that you are interested please let Sean know so that the Data Science Lab can support you!</p></li><li><p><strong>[Training: Cluster 101 Evaluation] </strong>Tuesday 1/3 we are kicking off a training evaluation of our Cluster 101 course that is a collaboration between Scientific Computing and the DaSL Training Crew. If you’d like to join (even if you know how to use our cluster already), you can do so any time before 1/13 and learn/provide your feedback join us over in <a href="https://fhdata.slack.com/archives/C043ZVCBY9Z">#ask-dasl</a>. The window for this round of feedback with active support from DaSL/SciComp is 2 weeks (then we’ll be busy integrating your input into the class). Your feedback will help many future newbies get introduced to and started working on our cluster! There are two links for this class (same content though!). You can take it as a Bookdown course: <a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_Cluster_Guide">https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_Cluster_Guide</a>/ or, if you’d like to get the certification, as a (free) Leanpub course: <a href="https://leanpub.com/courses/fredhutch/fredhutchcluster101">https://leanpub.com/courses/fredhutch/fredhutchcluster101</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/ics/Repeating-Events/DaSL-Data-House-Calls-Steam-Plant-Series.ics">Event: Data House Calls</a>] </strong>Wednesday 1/4 at 10am we’ll have our weekly<strong> </strong>Data House Calls drop in hour in Steam Plant (in the open conference room space behind the coffee machine on the south side of the 2nd floor) and <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3abe85aa58c3624fb79c1590342ec75c63%40thread.skype/1662005548439?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%220054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%223e04c34b-5757-41eb-859a-2ca7ed21694c%22%7d">on Teams</a>. Drop by to talk about needed support for data challenges, coding challenges, computing questions, data management, etc.&nbsp; If the DaSL team can’t help you, they will be able to ping several other folks with different skill sets (including SciComp, the DaSL training group, the Hutch Data Core, etc) and get the right connections for you.</p></li></ul><h2>Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar</h2><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://twitter.com/ikashnitsky/status/1609550464739074048">Blog Post: Map Aesthetics</a>]</strong> Demographer <a href="https://twitter.com/ikashnitsky">Ilya Kashnitsky</a> will show you how to improve all of your map visualizations with (you guessed it) one weird trick.</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://twitter.com/rlmcelreath/status/1609624008382627843">Open Course: Statistical Rethinking</a>]</strong> Anthropologist <a href="https://twitter.com/rlmcelreath">Richard McElreath</a> is posting the newest iteration of his masterclass “Statistical Rethinking.“</p></li></ul><p>As always you can contact us by replying directly to this email, you can email Jeff Leek, Amy Paguirigan, and Sean Kross at data@fredhutch.org, or you are welcome to join us on the F<a href="https://fhdata.slack.com/">red Hutch Data Slack Workspace</a>.
