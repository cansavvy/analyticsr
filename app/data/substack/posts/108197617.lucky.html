<h2><strong>Good morning!</strong></h2><p>Welcome to the nineteenth ever issue of Monday Morning Data Science from the <a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/">Fred Hutch Data Science Laboratory</a>. We are excited to show you what we have been working on (Fresh from the Lab), plus links that we think you would be interested in (Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar). Part of <strong>the purpose of this newsletter is to start conversations</strong>, so if you have a question or there is something you would like to share with us please <strong>let us know by responding directly to this email</strong>.</p><h2>Fresh from the Lab</h2><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/datahousecalls/">New Regime for Data House Calls</a>]</strong> Given the diversity of topics folks have brought to Data House Calls, and DaSLâ€™s desire to meet people where they are at (in a hybrid and time-aware sort of way), we've shifted the format to ensure that everyone has some focused time to discuss their specific questions. This was a huge success last week! If you have questions about anything data-related, from here on out you can, at any time, schedule a Data House Call via the link above.</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://substack.com/redirect/0a4e803c-0186-49db-a3db-47c148ab5ae4?j=eyJ1IjoiMXJtbHIxIn0.-2hzdutkiB0DCxD-ks5m7x-UXQ23Y8j3s8ZXxlHmWg0__;!!GuAItXPztq0!h8N3AGfRkYVo3r9z-NjVak97n1MnnpPL8MzRGdndi2FeLDdzHJU4xJNB9vrY7DJtHqD14CL8XUOaML0ikl4%24">Event: Effective Computing Drop in Hour</a>] </strong>Wednesday 3/15 at 2pm the Effective Computing user group will meet again (they meet every other week) in room M1-B406 and <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://substack.com/redirect/cfc49b3e-91ae-4d73-8f3d-c3ab1aeaa172?j=eyJ1IjoiMXJtbHIxIn0.-2hzdutkiB0DCxD-ks5m7x-UXQ23Y8j3s8ZXxlHmWg0__;!!GuAItXPztq0!h8N3AGfRkYVo3r9z-NjVak97n1MnnpPL8MzRGdndi2FeLDdzHJU4xJNB9vrY7DJtHqD14CL8XUOa0vPoaY0%24">here on Teams</a>.
