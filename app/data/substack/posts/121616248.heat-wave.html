<h2><strong>Good morning!</strong></h2><p>Welcome to the twenty eighth ever issue of Monday Morning Data Science from the <a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/">Fred Hutch Data Science Laboratory</a>. We are excited to show you what we have been working on (Fresh from the Lab), plus links that we think you would be interested in (Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar). Part of <strong>the purpose of this newsletter is to start conversations</strong>, so if you have a question or there is something you would like to share with us please <strong>let us know by responding directly to this email</strong>.</p><h2>Fresh from the Lab</h2><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/projects/userdropin/#r-user-group">Event: R User Group</a>] </strong>Tuesday 5/16 at 1pm the monthly R User Group will be meeting in the Arnold building in M1-B406 and online only <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a78f58da7a7ad414fb4d628f8ba974ee3%40thread.skype/1668473281445?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%220054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22fe38bc0c-bc6f-4396-bf10-c217dda4deb3%22%7d">on Teams</a>. Do you have a bunch for R scripts and functions that you use over and over again? Come learn how to put all of those scripts into your very own R package. If you would like to talk about an R subject that you are interested please let Sean know so that the Data Science Lab can support you in future iterations of this event.</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/jobs/">Jobs Jobs Jobs!</a>]</strong> The Data Science Lab is in its fledgling year and is hoping to grow in the near future.&nbsp; When jobs are ready, we’ll post them on our Jobs page (<a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/jobs/">https://hutchdatascience.org/jobs/</a>).&nbsp; In the meantime if you’re curious about what DaSL is up to and interested in potentially joining the team in the future, you can schedule an informational interview with Sean and Amy <a href="https://calendly.com/d/yvt-c2h-5gg/informational-interview-with-dasl">using this link</a>.</p></li></ul><h2>Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar</h2><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/f0f7h5cu/release/2">Article: Software Engineering Practices in Academia</a>] </strong>Discover how integrating readability, resilience, and reuse as key principles in data science projects can enhance research outcomes. Explore the unique challenges and opportunities faced by academia, and learn about strategies for selecting appropriate levels of software engineering rigor, improving skill training, and fostering interdisciplinary communities of practice.</p></li></ul><p>As always you can contact us by replying directly to this email, you can email Jeff Leek, Amy Paguirigan, and Sean Kross at data@fredhutch.org, or you are welcome to join us on the F<a href="https://fhdata.slack.com/">red Hutch Data Slack Workspace</a>.
