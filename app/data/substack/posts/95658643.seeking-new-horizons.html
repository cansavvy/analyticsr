If you’d like to join (even if you know how to use our cluster already), you can do so any time before 1/13 and learn/provide your feedback join us over in <a href="https://fhdata.slack.com/archives/C043ZVCBY9Z">#ask-dasl</a> The window for this round of feedback with active support from DaSL/SciComp is 2 weeks (then we’ll be busy integrating your input into the class!) Your feedback will help many future newbies get introduced to and started working on our cluster! There are two links for this class (same content though!). You can take it as a Bookdown course: <a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_Cluster_Guide">https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_Cluster_Guide</a>/ or, if you’d like to get the certification, as a (free) Leanpub course: <a href="https://leanpub.com/courses/fredhutch/fredhutchcluster101">https://leanpub.com/courses/fredhutch/fredhutchcluster101</a>.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar</h2><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://rabernat.medium.com/responsibility-and-authority-academia-vs-startup-18524488e9ac">Blog Post: Work Life in Academia vs. At a Startup</a>]</strong> Columbia University professor and startup founder <a href="https://twitter.com/rabernat">Ryan Abernathey</a> talks about working at his growing startup compared to his previous experiences working in academia.</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://worksinprogress.substack.com/p/the-stats-gap?sd=pf">Magazine Article: The Stats Gap</a>]</strong> Zoologist <a href="https://twitter.com/pastasnack_e">Ellen Pasternack</a> writes about shortcomings in college-level statistics education.</p></li></ul><p>As always you can contact us by replying directly to this email, you can email Jeff Leek, Amy Paguirigan, and Sean Kross at data@fredhutch.org, or you are welcome to join us on the F<a href="https://fhdata.slack.com/">red Hutch Data Slack Workspace</a>.
