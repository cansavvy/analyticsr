If you would like to talk about an R subject that you are interested please let Sean know so that the data science lab can support you!</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/ics/Repeating-Events/DaSL-Data-House-Calls-Steam-Plant-Series.ics">Event: Data House Calls</a>] </strong>Wednesday 12/7 at 10am we’ll have our weekly Data House Calls drop in hour in Steam Plant (in the open conference room space behind the coffee machine on the south side of the 2nd floor) and <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3abe85aa58c3624fb79c1590342ec75c63%40thread.skype/1662005548439?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%220054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%223e04c34b-5757-41eb-859a-2ca7ed21694c%22%7d">on Teams</a>. Drop by to talk about needed support for data challenges, coding challenges, computing questions, data management, etc.&nbsp; If the DaSL team can’t help you, they will be able to ping several other folks with different skill sets (including SciComp, the DaSL training group, the Hutch Data Core, etc) and get the right connections for you.</p></li><li><p><strong>[Training: Evaluating WDL 101]</strong> On 11/28 we kicked off a training evaluation of <a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_WDL101_Cromwell/">WDL 101: Running WDL workflows at Fred Hutch using Cromwell</a>. If you’d like to join, you can do so any time before 12/9 and learn/provide your feedback join us over in <a href="https://fhdata.slack.com/archives/C043ZVCBY9Z">#ask-dasl</a> The window for this round of <a href="https://fhdata.slack.com/archives/C043ZVCBY9Z/p1669052341356669">feedback/support </a>is 2 weeks and the course should only take 30-45 minutes if you know how to get on Rhino already. You could save way more time than that day to day by learning how to integrate this tool into managing your computational work on the cluster.</p></li></ul><h2>Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar</h2><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT (Obviously)</a>] </strong>OpenAI’s newest GPT model and interface launched and is all over our internet feeds.
