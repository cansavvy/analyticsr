Metformin was associated with a 42% relative decrease in the incidence of long COVID compared to the control group.</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://twitter.com/greglinden/status/1606785330505740288">Blog Post: For Notifications, Less is More</a>]</strong> The Facebook Notifications Data Science team found that users prefer to receive fewer notifications (Hallelujah). When the team sent fewer notifications that were predicted to be more relevant to users, app usage decreased initially but increased over time. Understanding the long-term effects of notifications on user behavior is key to improving user experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://twitter.com/stevenstrogatz/status/1606684996793618432">Article: The Monty Hall Problem</a>]</strong> The Monty Hall problem is a famous mathematical problem which asks whether you would be better off switching or sticking with your original door choice in a game show scenario where there are three doors, one of which has a car behind it and the other two have goats.
