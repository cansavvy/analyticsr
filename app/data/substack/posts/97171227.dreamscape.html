<h2><strong>Good morning!</strong></h2><p>Welcome to the twelfth ever issue of Monday Morning Data Science from the <a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/">Fred Hutch Data Science Laboratory</a>. We are excited to show you what we have been working on (Fresh from the Lab), plus links that we think you would be interested in (Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar). Part of <strong>the purpose of this newsletter is to start conversations</strong>, so if you have a question or there is something you would like to share with us please <strong>let us know by responding directly to this email</strong>.</p><h2>Fresh from the Lab</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Canceled:</strong> Tuesday’s R User Group is canceled since our host will be OOO.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tuesday 1/17</strong> we’re kicking off a <strong>training evaluation</strong> of <a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_WDL101_Cromwell/">WDL 101: Running WDL workflows at Fred Hutch using Cromwell</a>. If you’d like to join, you can do so any time before 1/27 and learn/provide your feedback join us over in <a href="https://fhdata.slack.com/archives/C043ZVCBY9Z">#ask-dasl</a> The window for this round of feedback/support is 2 weeks and the course should only take 30-45 minutes if you know how to get on Rhino already. You could save way more time than that day to day by learning how to integrate this tool into managing your computational work on the cluster. We’ll meet 1/27 at 130p to discuss any thoughts, issues and suggestions synchronously!</p></li><li><p><strong>Wednesday 1/18 at 10am</strong> we’ll have our weekly<strong> Data House Calls drop in hour</strong> in Steam Plant (in the open conference room space behind the coffee machine on the south side of the 2nd floor) and <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3abe85aa58c3624fb79c1590342ec75c63%40thread.skype/1662005548439?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%220054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%223e04c34b-5757-41eb-859a-2ca7ed21694c%22%7d">on Teams</a>. Drop by to talk about needed support for data challenges, coding challenges, computing questions, data management, etc.&nbsp; If the DaSL team can’t help you, they will be able to ping several other folks with different skill sets (including SciComp, the DaSL training group, the Hutch Data Core, etc) and get the right connections for you.</p></li></ul><p>As always you can contact us by replying directly to this email, you can email Jeff Leek, Amy Paguirigan, and Sean Kross at data@fredhutch.org, or you are welcome to join us on the F<a href="https://fhdata.slack.com/">red Hutch Data Slack Workspace</a>.
