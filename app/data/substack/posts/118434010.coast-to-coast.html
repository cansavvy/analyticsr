<h2><strong>Good morning!</strong></h2><p>Welcome to the twenty sixth ever issue of Monday Morning Data Science from the <a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/">Fred Hutch Data Science Laboratory</a>. We are excited to show you what we have been working on (Fresh from the Lab), plus links that we think you would be interested in (Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar). Part of <strong>the purpose of this newsletter is to start conversations</strong>, so if you have a question or there is something you would like to share with us please <strong>let us know by responding directly to this email</strong>.</p><h2>Fresh from the Lab</h2><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://hutchdatascience.org/datahousecalls/">Data House Calls</a>]</strong> Given the diversity of topics folks have brought to Data House Calls, and DaSLâ€™s desire to meet people where they are at (in a hybrid and time-aware sort of way), we've shifted the format to ensure that everyone has some focused time to discuss their specific questions. If you have questions about anything data-related, from here on out you can, at any time, schedule a Data House Call via the link above.</p></li></ul><h2>Our Weekly Bookmarks Bar</h2><ul><li><p><strong>[<a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/posts/2023-04-28-imputation-might-be-silly/">Blog Post: When is complete case analysis unbiased?</a>]</strong> Explore friend of the lab <a href="https://twitter.com/LucyStats">Lucy D'Agostino McGowan's</a> deep dive into complete case analysis and missing data in prediction models.
